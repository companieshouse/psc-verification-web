This is a web frontend for the PSC Verification Statements. It was created based on [Typescript Web Starter for Companies House](https://github.com/companieshouse/node-review-web-starter-ts). For the corresponding API component, see [psc-verification-api](https://github.com/companieshouse/psc-verification-api).

## Frontend technologies and utils

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
- [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks)
- [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/)
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io)
- [SuperTest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/supertest)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Installing and running

### Requirements

1. node v22 (engines block in package.json is used to enforce this)
2. npm >=v10 (engines block in package.json is used to enforce this)

Having cloned the project into the working directory, run the following commands:

```shell
cd psc-verification-web
npm install
make clean build
```

The build step will additionally clone the required [companieshouse/api-enumerations](https://github.com/companieshouse/api-enumerations/) submodule.

### Running the Tests

To run all tests with coverage, use the following command:

```shell
make test
```

For more details on our approach to testing, as well as generating coverage reports, see [LLD > Testing](./docs/testing.md).

### Running the App

Running the app will require the use of [companieshouse/docker-chs-development](https://github.com/companieshouse/docker-chs-development) (private repo) to bootstrap the necessary environment. Once set up, you can enable the service like so:

```shell
chs-dev modules enable psc-verification
chs-dev services enable psc-verification-web
```

If you also want to enable development mode (debugging & hot reload):

```shell
chs-dev development enable psc-verification-web
```

To start the application, run:

```shell
chs-dev up
```

...and navigate to http://chs.local/persons-with-significant-control-verification (or whatever host values your config points to).

If you've enabled development mode, you can attach a debugger at `localhost:9236`. Each time you save the source code Nodemon will be triggered to reload the web service (~7 seconds); session data will be preserved.
