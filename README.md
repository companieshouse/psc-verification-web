## Installing and running

### Requirements

1. node v20 (engines block in package.json is used to enforce this)
2. npm v10 (engines block in package.json is used to enforce this)

Having cloned the project into your project root, run the following commands:

```cd psc-verification-web```

```npm install```

```make clean build``` which will add the git submodule `api-enumerations`

### SSL Set-up

- If you wish to work with ssl-enabled endpoints locally, ensure you turn the `NODE_SSL_ENABLED` property to `ON` in the config and also provide paths to your private key and certificate.

- In a typical production environment, this might never be required as the Node app usually sits behind a load balancer with SSL termination.

### Running the Tests

To run the tests, type the following command:

``` npm test ```

To get a summarised test coverage report, run:

```npm run coverage```

For a detailed test coverage report, run one of the following commands:

```npm run coverage:report```

or

```npm run test:coverage```

For these tests, we've used [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/) with [Sinon](http://sinonjs.org/) and [Chai](http://chaijs.com/).

### Running the App

To start the application, run:

``` npm start ```

or, to watch for changes with auto restart in your dev environment, run:

``` npm run start:watch ```

...and navigate to http://localhost:3000/ (or whatever hostname/port number combination you've changed the config values to)

For SSL connections, navigate to https://localhost:3443
